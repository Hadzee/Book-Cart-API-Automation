Title: Add to Cart Test for the Book Cart App

Description:
As a user, I should be able to successfully log in to the Book Cart App, add a book to the cart, and verify that it was added successfully.


Test Steps:

GIVEN that I log in to the Book Cart App
WHEN I click on "Add to Cart" for one of the books
THEN I navigate to the Cart
AND I verify that the book was successfully added
AND I navigate back to the Home page
THEN I select my user in the top right corner
AND I click on the Logout option from the dropdown
THEN I can see that I am navigated back to the login page


Reason it is considered a smoke test:
I am validating the core functionality where I log in successfully, add a book to the shopping cart, verify that it was added, then log out.
