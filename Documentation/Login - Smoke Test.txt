Title: Login Test for the Book Cart App

Description:
As a user, I should be able to successfully log in to the Book Cart App, and verify that the Home page is displayed. This test is referring to test_add_contact.py


Test Steps:

GIVEN that I navigate to the Book Cart Login page
WHEN I enter my username
AND I enter my password
THEN I click on the Login button
AND I verify that the Home page is displayed with a list of books
AND I can see that the categories are displayed where I can filter the books
THEN I select my user in the top right corner
AND I click on the Logout option from the dropdown
THEN I can see that I am navigated back to the login page


Reason it is considered a smoke test:
I am validating the core functionality that I can log in successfully, verify that the home page is displayed, and log out after that without issues.
