Title: Add to Cart Negative Test Case for the Book Cart App

Description:
As a user, I should not be able to add a book to the cart if I am not authenticated,
or if I provide an invalid token


Test Steps:

GIVEN that I am not logged in, or I have an invalid token
WHEN I try to add a book to the cart
THEN the API should respond with an error status code (401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden)
AND I should see an appropriate error message indicating that the authentication failed
AND I am not allowed to proceed with adding the book to the cart


Reason it is considered a negative test:

The test verifies that the system behaves correctly when invalid data is provided.
It checks for security and proper error handling,
ensuring that unauthorized users cannot perform critical actions like adding items to the cart.
