Title: Checkout Test for the Book Cart App

Description:
As a user, I should be able to add a book to the cart, and verify that I can successfully navigate to the Checkout.


Test Steps:

GIVEN that I log in to the Book Cart App
WHEN I click on "Add to Cart" for one of the books
THEN I navigate to the Cart
AND I verify that the book was successfully added
THEN I click on the "Checkout" button
THEN I verify that the Checkout page is displayed
THEN I select my user in the top right corner
AND I click on the Logout option from the dropdown
THEN I can see that I am navigated back to the login page


Reason it is considered a smoke test:
I am validating the core functionality where I add a book to the shopping cart, and I verify that I can successfully navigate to the Checkout page, then log out.
