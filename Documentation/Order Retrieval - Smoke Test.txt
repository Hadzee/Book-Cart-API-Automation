Title: Order Retrieval Test for the Book Cart App

Description:
As a user, I should be able to add a book to the cart, place the order on the Checkout page, and verify my order details.

Test Steps:

GIVEN that I log in to the Book Cart App
WHEN I click on "Add to Cart" for one of the books
THEN I navigate to the Cart
AND I verify that the book was successfully added
THEN I click on the "Checkout" button
THEN I verify that the Checkout page is displayed
AND I enter my name for the shipping address
AND I enter my address line 1
AND I enter the address line 2
AND I enter the Pincode (I make sure I enter a 6-digit number, also the first number cannot be 0)
AND I enter my State
Then I click on the "Place Order" button
AND I can see that I'm navigated to the "My Orders" page
THEN I verify that my order is displayed correctly
THEN I select my user in the top right corner
AND I click on the Logout option from the dropdown
THEN I can see that I am navigated back to the login page


Reason it is considered a smoke test:
I am validating the core functionality where I add a book to the shopping cart, place an order on the Checkout page, and verify that the order is displayed on the "My Orders" page.
